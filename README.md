On August 25, 2025 Mayor Dave Siedell and Commissioner Frank Troy introduced a law that could jail homeless people for sleeping outside. A five hour public comment period ensued. The official recording of that meeting can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjO2hV16Anc&ab_channel=BoroughofHaddonfield).

Despite overwhelming rejection by Haddonfield residents and warnings from experts that the law would expose Haddonfield to costly lawsuits and worsen the burdens on homeless people, Mayor Siedell and Commissioner Troy voted to advance the law.

### A Bad Look for Haddonfield

At the August 25 meeting Richard Uniacke, president of Bridges Outreach, a nonprofit that connects homeless people with resources and wrap-around services, spoke extensively against the law proposed by Mayor Siedell and Commissioner Troy.

Uniacke stated that Haddonfield has 31 students that qualify for free and reduced price lunch. "These are families living on the edge. What would you have them do if someone should face housing insecurity or homelessness?"

Uniacke added: "In New Jersey it costs approximately $75,000 to incarcerate a human, where as it costs on average $12,050 to rapidly house a two-person household for a year."

Uniacke informed the Commissioners that "Heading down the path of institutionalization and incarceration is not just wrong, it’s not just a bad look, it’s also not cost-effective."

### Costly Litigation for Haddonfield?

Jeff Wild, litigation partner at Lowenstein Sandler, and trustee at NJ Coalition to End Homelesness said at the Augst 25 Haddonfield Commisioners’ Meeting:

"The right answer to ending homelessness is to help people find housing. And there is absolutely no need for Haddonfield to enact an ordinance that can be used to fine, or put unhoused people in jail. The Board should table this proposed ordinance which I submit is illegal under New Jersey law."

### Repeating the Mistakes of Other Towns

Summit, New Jersey already introduced a similar law that was [later withdrawn after public outcry](https://gothamist.com/news/wealthy-nj-city-rethinks-law-that-could-jail-homeless-people-after-public-outcry).

The entire debacle resulted in a black eye for the town. Why are Mayor Siedell and Commissioner Troy making the same mistake for Haddonfield?
