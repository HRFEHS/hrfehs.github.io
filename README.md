# The Public Comment Period â€” Official Video

On August 25, 2025 Mayor Dave Siedell and Commissioner Frank Troy introduced a law that could jail homeless people for sleeping outside. A five hour public comment period ensued. The official recording of that meeting can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjO2hV16Anc&ab_channel=BoroughofHaddonfield).

Despite overwhelming rejection by Haddonfield residents and warnings from experts that the law would expose Haddonfield to costly lawsuits and worsen the burdens on homeless people, Mayor Siedell and Commissioner Troy voted to advance the law.
